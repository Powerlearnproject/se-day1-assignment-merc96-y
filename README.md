Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles ,methods and tools to development and maintenance og high quality software systems.
IMPORTANCE IN TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY
enables creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern  life for example communication and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
FIRST MILESTONE 
development of programming languages e.g Fortran
SECOND MILESTONE 
establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 60s.
THIRD MILESTONE
the advent of structured programming in the 70s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
software development life cycle consist of several phases including ;
-requrements involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
-design involves creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
implementation writing the code building softqware according to specification'
 testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches
 deployment releasing the software to users or customers.
 maintenance providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodoly uses a sequential approach with distinct phases e.g requirements, design flowing sequentially while agile methodology is iterative and incremental approach focusing on flexibility ,collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SOFTWARE DEVELOPER
writes codes and implements software solutions.
QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER
designs and executes test plans to ensure software quality.
PROJECT MANAGER
oversees planning ,execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing ,debugging and testing code eg visual studio.
VCS hels track changes to source codecode and coordinating work among team members eg git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
changing requirements.
tight deadlines.
technical debt.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing is testing individual components or modules of software.
integratin is testing interactions between different components.
system testing tests the entire software  system as a whole.
acceptance testing tests the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
tsting ensures quality assurance.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is giving clear instructions to get best possible responses from AI models.
it helps avoid getting confusing responses by giving specific and clear questions for required feedback.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
'write an essay' is the vague version while 'write an essay on the use of social media among the youth' is the improved version. since it specifies what the essay should be about.
